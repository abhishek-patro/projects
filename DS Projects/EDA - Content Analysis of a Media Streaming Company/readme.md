### âœ¨EDAâœ¨

  - How has the number of movies released per year changed over the last 20-30 years?
  - What is the best time to launch a TV show?
  - Understanding what content is available in different countries
  - Comparison of tv shows vs. movies.


## ðŸ“±Recommendations & Insights

- Most of the shows are catered to mature audiences, but diversifying content genres is also important to attract a broader range of viewers. A mix of genres, including drama, comedy, action, romance, and documentary, should be offered to cater to varied tastes.

- Given the popularity of TV-14 rated content, more shows and movies should be tailored for the late teens demographic.

- Experimentation with other genres like Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Thriller, and Documentaries can be done.

- Due to kids shorter attention spans, more shows of length 15-20 minutes should be available. Side by side, it is also very important to implement robust parental controls and ensure that the content is suitable for this age group.

- Focus should be on producing movies that fall within the popular 1-hour to 2-hour duration range.

- A strategic approach is to develop TV shows spanning 3-5 seasons, with each season having a compelling cliffhanger to captivate viewers' interest and anticipation, making them eagerly await the next season.

- Additionally, brief glimpses of behind-the-scenes or entertaining bloopers can be shared, providing a relatable and authentic connection to the audience.

- Some of the oldest movies that were not present and were released before 2010 can be added, which will help cater to the elderly audience, creating a feeling of nostalgia. This will work especially well in a country like Japan due to its higher older demographic.

- The trend of adding most TV shows and movies on Fridays and Thursdays in the first and last weeks of December and July can be leveraged. The release of highly anticipated original content can be done during these months to attract maximum viewership.

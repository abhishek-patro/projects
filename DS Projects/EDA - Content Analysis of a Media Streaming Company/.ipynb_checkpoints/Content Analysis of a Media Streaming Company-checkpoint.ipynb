    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Most of the shows are catered to mature audiences. Diversifying content genres is also important to attract a broader range of viewers. A mix of genres, including drama, comedy, action, romance, and documentary, to cater to varied tastes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Given the popularity of TV-14 rated content, more shows and movies should be tailored for the late teens demographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Can Experiment with other genres like Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Thriller, and Documentaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Due to kids less attention span, shows of length 15-20 mins should be available more. Side by Side it is also very important to implement a robust parental control and ensure that the content is suitable for this age group\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Focus on producing movies that fall within the popular 1-hour to 2-hour duration range.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A strategic approach is to develop TV shows spanning 3-5 seasons, with each season having a compelling cliffhanger.  This will captivate viewers interest and anticipation, making them to eagerly await for the next season.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Additionally we can create brief glimpses of behind the screens or share entertaining bloopers, providing a relatable and authentic connection to our audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Some of the most old movies that are not present can be added, that were released before 2010, which will help to cater the elderly audience, creating a feeling of nostalgia. It will work especially well in a country like Japan due its higher older demographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The trend of adding most TV shows and movies in Friday and Thursday in the first and last week of Decemeber and July can be leveraged. The release of highly anticipated original content can be done during these months to attract maximum viewership.\n",
